					<h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
					<p>While this may seem obvious being that I live here, I have been playing shows in the STL area since I was 15 years old. While St. Louis gets sometimes overlooked on the national scale, as far as touring goes, it really is such a fantastic music town and I love calling it home. </p>

					<h2>Columbia, MO</h2>
					<p>I've only played in Columbia a few times and they have all been at the same place, Rose Music Hall. Great dive-bar vibe.</p>

					<h2>Kansaas City, MO</h2>
					<p>One of my band's favorite stops on tour was Westport Saloon in Kansas City. While the shows were always great, the staff was also amazing and they even provided lodging upstairs above the venue. This was particularly great after a night of...celebrating. Sadly, Westport Saloon closed a few years ago and I'm not sure any of us has ever fully recovered.</p>

					<h2>Chicago, IL</h2>
					<p>Chicago doesn't really need a lot of explanation. GREAT music city and forever a stop on any artists' tour.</p>
